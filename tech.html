						<p class="intro"><strong>"What technical subject are you interested in?"</strong>, is not such a hard question to answer for me. I'm absolutely amazed by the progress we have made in the field of automation, AI and machine learning - they go hand in hand, obviously. There's no doubt that AI can facilitate people's lives and businesses alike to do away with alot of redundant work, and make them more productive, down to the scale of the individual employee.</p>
						<p>When I taught my students about business software, I explained them how the degree of automation that is brought by these products creates value for every one concerned. Employees can do away with repetitive tasks, and focus on the creative and inter-human processes that are most rewarding. And yet, when I looked around I found lots of colleagues still losing way to much time doing the same repetitive stuff over and over again.</p>
						<h2>Automation and optimisation is the target, AI is the key. </h2>
						<p>In my opninion, the reason is that people aren't aware sometimes what can be automated, or they are affraid they will be making themselves redundant. Whatever the case, I'm convinced this is where AI can absolutely be of great help. Managers don't always have the micro-view of daily operations that is needed to find these losses of productivity. But since more and more compagnies are evermore data-driven, the next logical step would be to have algorithms looking for possible gains. These gains can even be in automating individual tasks, if algorithms get smart enough to detect "automatable or redundant" work. Even better if they can offer automation proposals to the employee, that are understandable and make sense. </p>
						<h2>Insight-providing datastreams will be the new gold!</h2>

								<figcaption><em>The wrong kind of AI!</em></figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Since this data is gathered through CRM/ERP/classic and cloud-based productivity suites, the companies that deliver these (Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, and to a lesser extent Google- but they have other sources) are sitting on a large amount of data that can be analised to make industry-wide gains. I think that the only reason this isn't happening on a large scale yet, is because most business people don't really understand <em>(yet)</em> how AI can benefit them, and therefore, they don't invest the time. Nevertheless, a large shift may be emminent, now more and more companies are working ever more digital, because of the impact of the COVID-pandemic.</p>

						<h2></h2>
						<p>So that's where I think most interesting developments will happen over the coming years. Pair these developments with the amount of data that is being gathered by smart appliances and phones and there's no doubt that decent algorithms to parse these huge datastreams will need to be ever-improving to keep up with the competition. </p>
