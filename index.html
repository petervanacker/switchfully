						<p class="intro">Hi guys,</p>
						<p class="intro">thanks for taking the time to look at my website development exercise. My name is Peter and I'm happy to join our team of fresh IT-recruits. I'm a man of many interests, and I'm looking forward to pursuing this one along with you. Please allow me to introduce a few of my other interest to you.</p>
						<h2>Family Life</h2>
						<p>Especially in the current situation, there's nothing more important than family, so it's only fair I introduce myself as a dad first. I know all parents believe this, but I actually have the two best kids in the world -true fact. My daughter Caelynn is a 6-year old princess that kills zombies in Minecraft, and my son Thorgal is the funniest 3-year-old ever; you should hear him tell his joke about the rabbit and the carrotcake. He loves to change into his "spidermansuit" <em>- that's what he calls his spiderman-pjs -</em> when it's time for bed, until it's actually time for bed. My wife and me got married 6 years ago, but have been together for over eighteen years already. She's a true partner in the broadest sence, and I can't even imagine a life without her, backing me up.</p>
						<h2>Music was my first love...</h2>
						<p>I recently upgraded my old CASIO keyboard that had been serving me well for over 10 years, all the way through conservatory. I finally have a "real" piano now, and enjoy playing it alot. I'm not the greatest pianist, but it makes for great melancholic evenings just improvising on a tune or chord progression. When it's not late at night, my family sometimes sings along, and it brings great atmosphere to our little bubble. I got a degree as a musical actor, some 15 years ago, so you can imagine I like singing along just as much.</p>

						<h2>Fighting the good fight</h2>
						<p>Since the start of the COVID-pandemic I've been working from home and I started missing some exercise. So I picked up HEMA, Historical European Martial Arts, since last september. If you've never heard of it, that's fine. It's basically like fencing, but with medieval swords. Obviously trainings are suspended for now, but I hope they will restart soon, since I found it to be the perfect combination of a firm work-out and sheer badassness ;-)</p>
						<h2>If all else fails, there's always PC-gaming!</h2>
						<p>I find playing computer games a perfect way to blow of steam (no pun intended). And it's a way to do something together with people outside my family-bubble these days, that isn't heavily impacted by the current health crisis. I like long saturday nights, playing co-op games with my brother, but to be fair, just a quick session after the kids have gone to bed is sometimes enough to make me forget we can't go out and do stuff!</p>
